- Error viewing pages for builder and spinner error queues in redis  
- better dict merging for templates (and one that doesn't break everything)
- maybe better searching of hipache routes? By name or destination maybe?
- Maybe look into eventually moving to the python supplied daemon tools
- controller to send pause/start commands to the spinner and builder
- Write things on the domain settings for containers
